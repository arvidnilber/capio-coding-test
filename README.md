# Capio Coding Test

I used Expo Router since I believe it's the simplest way to work with React Native today. 
It's like Next.JS but for React Native.

Let Claude do the boilerplate from the requirements. But had to make changes to layout, colors and auth logic. 

To run the expo app, just install using npm, install the expo run npx expo run:(ios/android/web).

If I had more time (and this was for a real project) I would've used Nativewind for styling (Tailwind for React Native). So the theme part of this project is little messy, but it works and has dark mode support.

Thank you for your time and hope you don't have any issues running this locally. It was a fun and well thought out code test.
