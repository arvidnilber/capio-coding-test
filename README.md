# Capio Coding Test

I used Expo Router since I believe it's the simplest way to work with React Native today. And it takes alot more time to setup a pure react native app and it's harder to read imo. 

It's like Next.JS but for React Native. It also gives you a web app.

Let Claude do the boilerplate from the requirements. But had to make changes to layout, colors and auth logic. 

Used MMKV and Zustand for store management, MMKV is super perforant and zustand has a really good hook api for react apps. 


To run the expo app, just install using npm, install the expo run npx expo run:(ios/android/web).

If I had more time (and this was for a real project) I would've used Nativewind for styling (Tailwind for React Native). So the theme part of this project is little messy, but it works and has dark mode support.

Thank you for your time and hope you don't have any issues running this locally. It was a fun and well thought out code test.
